## Purpose
I love a nice juicy steak with a perfectly seared crust and cooked medium-rare evenly through.  To do that, I use my sous vide, but I often forget what temperature to set my sous vide at and how long it’ll take to cook.  That’s where the Sous Vide Calculator comes in!

## What is it?
Sous Vide Calculator is a front-end web application that allows an amateur chef to select the type of meat, type of cut, and desired doneness one at a time through a short series of menus with buttons.  When all selections are made, the page displays the appropriate temperature to set your sous vide to and how long it will take to cook.

Ex. Beef -> Steak -> Medium rare =>  

Temp: 128 degrees  
Time: 1 hour
